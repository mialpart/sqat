Implement static code coverage metrics by Alves & Visser 
(https://www.sig.eu/en/about-sig/publications/static-estimation-test-coverage)


The relevant base data types provided by M3 can be found here:

- module analysis::m3::Core:

rel[loc name, loc src]        M3.declarations;            // maps declarations to where they are declared. contains any kind of data or type or code declaration (classes, fields, methods, variables, etc. etc.)
rel[loc name, TypeSymbol typ] M3.types;                   // assigns types to declared source code artifacts
rel[loc src, loc name]        M3.uses;                    // maps source locations of usages to the respective declarations
rel[loc from, loc to]         M3.containment;             // what is logically contained in what else (not necessarily physically, but usually also)
list[Message]                 M3.messages;                // error messages and warnings produced while constructing a single m3 model
rel[str simpleName, loc qualifiedName]  M3.names;         // convenience mapping from logical names to end-user readable (GUI) names, and vice versa
rel[loc definition, loc comments]       M3.documentation; // comments and javadoc attached to declared things
rel[loc definition, Modifier modifier] M3.modifiers;     // modifiers associated with declared things

- module  lang::java::m3::Core:

rel[loc from, loc to] M3.extends;            // classes extending classes and interfaces extending interfaces
rel[loc from, loc to] M3.implements;         // classes implementing interfaces
rel[loc from, loc to] M3.methodInvocation;   // methods calling each other (including constructors)
rel[loc from, loc to] M3.fieldAccess;        // code using data (like fields)
rel[loc from, loc to] M3.typeDependency;     // using a type literal in some code (types of variables, annotations)
rel[loc from, loc to] M3.methodOverrides;    // which method override which other methods
rel[loc declaration, loc annotation] M3.annotations;

Tips
- encode (labeled) graphs as ternary relations: rel[Node,Label,Node]
- define a data type for node types and edge types (labels) 
- use the solve statement to implement your own (custom) transitive closure for reachability.

Questions:
- what methods are not covered at all?
	Many of these uncovered methods are from UI,level and board classes
	
- how do your results compare to the jpacman results in the paper? Has jpacman improved?
	In that paper: Static 88.06%/ Clover 93.53%/ Difference âˆ’5.47%
	My coverage result was : 80.51282051 / Clover 76.6 / Difference about +4.1
	
	Seems like it hasnt. At least Coverage is smaller nowadays.

- use a third-party coverage tool (e.g. Clover) to compare your results to (explain differences)
	My coverage result was : 80.51282051 and Clover gave: 76.6 
	
	This static version works on source code
	
	Clover takes Statements and Methods and measures coverage while the whole program has been executed.
